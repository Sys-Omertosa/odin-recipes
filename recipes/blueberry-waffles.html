        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I use this blueberry waffle recipe to help use up the massive amount of berries I pick each summer. I am fortunate to have four blueberry bushes in my backyard, and they supply me with fresh blueberries all summer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2/3 cup blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the waffles: In a medium bowl, whisk together milk and egg yolks. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in melted butter and let stand for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease and preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff. Fold into batter with blueberries.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, scoop portions of the batter onto the preheated waffle iron. Cook each waffle until golden brown and the iron stops steaming, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir blueberries, 1/4 cup orange juice, and honey together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining 1/4 cup orange juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into the blueberry mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Serve warm over waffles.</li>
        </ol>
